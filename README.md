### Description:

There is a web-developer portfolio. You can use it as an example or as a base for your portfolio.

Any person can download this and restyle as he wish.

### Implementation notes:

I build the project with Gulp.
As CSS framework I chose Bootstrap and language - SCSS.

To start building, just run `gulp` command in the terminal.
It will build in to "/dist/" folder all you need to upload to your hosting.
