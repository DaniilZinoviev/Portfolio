### Description:

There is a web-developer portfolio that I build for myself. You can use it as an example or as a base for your portfolio :)

Any person can download this and restyle it as he wish. If I'll help to somebody with it, please, star the github repo.

### Implementation notes:

I build the project with Gulp.
As CSS framework I chose Bootstrap and language - SCSS.

To start building, just run `gulp` command in the terminal.
Ready-to-use build you'll find in the "/dist/" folder - all you need to upload to your PHP hosting.

### Libraries I use

Main:
 - bootstrap (CSS framework)
 - fontawesome (Icons)
 - jquery (Use only to animate scroll - can be removed)
 - isotope-layout (Filters for projects)
   - imagesloaded (Need to update layout after images will be loaded)

Additinal:
 - animate.css (Animation effects)
 - magnific-popup (Popup on click to project)
 - mmenu-light (Mobile menu)
 - particles.js (Particles at the header)
 - waypoints (Animations on page scroll)
 - smooth-scroll
